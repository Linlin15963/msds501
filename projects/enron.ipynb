The heat map is not symmetric because Susan sending mail to Xue is not the same thing as Xue sending mail to Susan. The first step is to group the data frame by `From` and `To` columns in order to get the number of emails from person $i$ to person $j$. Then, create a 2D numpy matrix, $C$, of integers and set $C_{i,j}$ to the count of person $i$ to person $j$. Using matplotlib, `ax.imshow(C, cmap='GnBu', vmax=4000)`, show the heat map and add tick labels at 45 degrees for the X axis. Set the labels to the appropriate names.   Draw the number of emails in the appropriate cells of the heat map, for all values greater than zero. Please note that when you draw text using `ax.text()`, the coordinates are X,Y whereas the coordinates in the $C$ matrix are row,column so you will have to flip the coordinates."
